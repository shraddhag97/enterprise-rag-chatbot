Enterprise RAG Chatbot is an internal AI assistant built for companies.

It helps employees ask questions about internal documents such as:
- company policies
- technical documentation
- onboarding guides

The chatbot uses Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
This means it first searches relevant documents and then uses an AI model to answer questions based only on those documents.

This chatbot is not trained on company data.
It only uses the documents provided to it at runtime.
